# fsyc-todo-app

This project was created during a workshop that I ran as part of an event with the ANU First-and-Second Year Computing Discord community.
You can view the project at https://fsyc-todo-app.web.app

I have not made the video for this project available publicly, due to privacy concerns.
However, I have commented App.vue thoroughly to help you understand how it works if you don't have access to the video.
